# **Title: House Price Prediction using Advanced Regression Techniques**

**Introduction**

This project aims to predict house prices accurately using a dataset from the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". The focus is on applying various regression modeling techniques and combining them for potentially improved performance.

**Dataset**

* **Source:** Kaggle competition - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques ([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques))
* **Description:** The dataset includes features about houses (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood) and their corresponding sale prices.

**Methodology**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   * Handling missing values (imputation techniques)
   * Addressing outliers
   * Encoding categorical features
   * Feature scaling or normalization (if necessary)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   * Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable (sale price)
   * Examining distributions of key variables
   * Identifying potential correlations

3. **Regression Modeling:**
   * Linear Regression
   * Lasso Regression 
   * Random Forest Regressor
   * Gradient Boosting Regressor
   * XGBoost Regressor 
   * LightGBM Regressor

4. **Model Evaluation**
   * Employing cross-validation techniques
   * Using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as a primary evaluation metric

5. **Model Ensembling:**
   * Averaging predictions from multiple models
   * Implementing stacking techniques

**Technologies**

* **Python**
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **Scikit-learn** 
* **XGBoost**
* **LightGBM**

**Usage**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
2. **Download Data:** Obtain the 'train.csv', 'test.csv', and 'sample_submission.csv' files from the Kaggle competition page.

**Results**

The project generates predictions in the form of submission files (e.g., 'rf_submission.csv'). Model performance metrics are displayed during execution.

**Future Directions**

* **Experiment with additional features:** Create new features or explore external datasets that might improve predictions.  
* **Hyperparameter tuning:** Fine-tune the models for potentially better performance.
* **Explore different ensemble methods:** Experiment with alternative model combination techniques.
